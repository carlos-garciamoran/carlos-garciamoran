## Hi 👋

My name is Carlos.

I am an ambitious tinkerer who likes building software to solve real problems.

I have recently released TweetWidget on the AppStore. [Give it a try!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tweetwidget/id1671704240)

I'm currently working on an app to leverage media as a force for doing good 🚀

Outside of computers, I enjoy:
- 🌲 exploring nature
- 🌍 traveling the world
- ♟️ playing chess
- 🤝 meeting people doing cool stuff
