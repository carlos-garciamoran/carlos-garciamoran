## Hi 👋

I'm a curious guy who likes writing software. I use Next.js for developing websites and Expo for mobile apps.

In my spare time, I'm building [Mobilecn UI](https://mobilecn.lol). Inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui), we are crafting opinionated-yet-customizable components for React Native and SwiftUI. Try our libraries to build beautiful user interfaces:
- [nativecn-ui](https://github.com/Mobilecn-UI/nativecn-ui) for React Native / Expo
- [swiftcn-ui](https://github.com/Mobilecn-UI/swiftcn-ui) for SwiftUI

Some past projects include:
- [SubletGo](https://subletgo.com): a platform aiming to make subletting easy & safe
- [CNCPT](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cncpt/id1662094973): app using media as a means to do good (part of The Concept Project) ⛰️
- [CoLive](https://www.getcolive.com): browse sublets from Facebook housing groups 🏠
- [TweetWidget](https://trytweetwidget.com): see tweets from your home screen 🐦📲
- [Hermes](https://github.com/carlos-garciamoran/hermes): trading bot accesible through Telegram 🔔📈

Outside of computers, I enjoy
- 🌲 exploring nature
- 🌍 traveling the world
- ♟️ playing chess
- 🤝 meeting people doing cool stuff
