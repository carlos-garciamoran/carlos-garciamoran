## Hi 👋

My name is Carlos.

I am a curious guy who likes building software to solve real problems.

Recently, I have been working on:
- [CoLive](https://www.getcolive.com) | The place to find your next sublet 🏠
- [TweetWidget](https://trytweetwidget.com) | See tweets from your home screen 🐦📲
- [CNCPT](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cncpt/id1662094973) | App using media as a means to do good ⛰️

Outside of computers, I enjoy
- 🌲 exploring nature
- 🌍 traveling the world
- ♟️ playing chess
- 🤝 meeting people doing cool stuff
