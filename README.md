## Hi 👋

My name is Carlos.

I am a curious guy who likes building software to solve real problems.

Currenly, I'm working on [subletgo.com](https://subletgo.com). Our vision is to make subletting easy, safe, and streamlined 🚀

Some past projects include:
- [CNCPT](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cncpt/id1662094973) | App using media as a means to do good ⛰️
- [CoLive](https://www.getcolive.com) | Browse sublets from Facebook housing groups 🏠
- [TweetWidget](https://trytweetwidget.com) | See tweets from your home screen 🐦📲

Outside of computers, I enjoy
- 🌲 exploring nature
- 🌍 traveling the world
- ♟️ playing chess
- 🤝 meeting people doing cool stuff
