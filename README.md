## Hi 👋

I am a curious guy who likes building software to solve real problems. I use Next.js for developing websites and Expo for mobile apps.

Currently, I'm building Mobilecn. Inspired by shadcn-ui's framework, our vision is to speed up mobile development. We are doing this by building ready-to-use components for React Native and SwiftUI. Try our libraries to build beautiful user interfaces:
- [nativecn-ui](https://github.com/Mobilecn-UI/nativecn-ui)
- [swiftcn-ui](https://github.com/Mobilecn-UI/swiftcn-ui)

I have also co-founded [SubletGo](https://subletgo.com), a platform aiming to make subletting easy & safe 🚀

Some past projects include:
- [CNCPT](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cncpt/id1662094973) | App using media as a means to do good (part of ) ⛰️
- [CoLive](https://www.getcolive.com) | Browse sublets from Facebook housing groups 🏠
- [TweetWidget](https://trytweetwidget.com) | See tweets from your home screen 🐦📲

Outside of computers, I enjoy
- 🌲 exploring nature
- 🌍 traveling the world
- ♟️ playing chess
- 🤝 meeting people doing cool stuff
